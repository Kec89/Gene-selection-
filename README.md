# Gene-selection-

This is to select ORFs with no overlapping transcriptional unit (on the same strand) 275 nt downstream the PAS.
Protein-coding genes that do not overlap with any other transcription unit (on the opposite strand) in a region from 250 nt upstream to 500 nt downstream of the PAS were selected for the analysis
